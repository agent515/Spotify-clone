# Spotify

**_Spotify_** is a well-known music player application. I made it's a look-alike web-application using `PHP`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `jQuery`. The application enables the logged-in user to play the song from the album of his favorite artist, add the song to his own playlist, and many more. In addition to basic audio-controls like play, stop & pause, the application also provides shuffle, loop, play next, play-previous, and also volume-controls. 

`MySql` was chosen as the database and `AJAX` is used to query the database. One of the most essential use of `AJAX` is in navigating through different pages. `AJAX` loads different pages in the main-container above controllers and to the right of Side-Navbar asynchronously. This keeps the song playing even while page transition.
